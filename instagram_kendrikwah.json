Is it because I tend to treat people equally, regardless of wherever they come from, whatever they've done, whoever they are? There are people telling me about how the labourers here cannot be trusted, and I think that's where this came from, and I've only just had the time to inspect this memory.\n\nBut then again, isn't that weird? If we can't trust them, why're we entrusting such important tasks to them? Its quite a peculiar observation that while we don't see ourselves toiling, sweating and struggling without any sense of appreciation, some of us would immediately put ourselves at the frontline of a orientation event that admittedly feels a lot less important than this.
