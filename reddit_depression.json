I felt super empty but also my mind was racing with thoughts. I had convinced myself I needed to finish my life today. I had been thinking for about half an hour when an elderly man sat across from me and gave me a hot chocolate. He said that he ordered it for me because he could tell I needed it. He told me \"I don't know what you're going through, but life will get better.\" And then he left. And then I cried.

My Dad is a pastor at our local church and both of my parents are EXTREMELY religious. They both hate gay people. I've known I was gay since I was a child but have always been scared about coming out in fear that they would reject me because they are very homophobic people. Whenever my parents see someone gay on TV they always say things like \"Look at that fucking faggot\" or \"That's disgusting\" and it just breaks my heart. I hate living with those fucking homophobes and I always take out my hatred by cutting myself. So far I've cut around 30 scars all over my thighs, butt, legs, and lower back. No one has ever seen these scars because I always wear jeans to cover them. At least not until a few days ago.\n\nWe were having a baby shower for my cousin and my mom insisted I wear a short ugly little dress that comes up to about my lower thigh. You could see every single fucking scar on my legs. I tried my best to cover the scars with my arms but when I stood up after dinner she saw them. She pointed at my legs and asked me what the hell is that so I told her everything. About how depressed I've been. About how many times I've contemplated suicide over the last few months. And about how I'm a lesbian. \n\nMy parents flipped the fuck out.\n\nMy dad started screaming a bunch of religious shit while throwing food at me. He told me that being gay was a sin and I was going to hell for this. He told me he didn't want \"no faggot daughter\". Then he angrily stomped out the room. My mom just looked at me in disgust for a few minutes before she spoke. She said, and these are her exact words, \"Just kill yourself you gay little bitch, you're not my daughter anymore.\"\n\nThat's all. She just said that and walked out.\n\nIt's been two days since that happened and now my parents refuse to talk to me. When they see me around the house they just ignore me like I'm not even there.\n\nI hate my life. So much.\n\nEDIT: Omg thank you guys for all the nice comments!!!
