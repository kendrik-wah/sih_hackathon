"To anyone out there who struggles with stress, anxiety or just the constant bombardment of life\u2019s obstacles, I\u2019m here to tell you that everything is going to be ok.\n\nAs someone who has battled life\u2019s stressors, as well as falling down to rock bottom several times, I can promise you that these hard moments you\u2019re going through are only temporary. Nothing is permanent. Your pain and hardships are merely a fleeting moment through time that presents itself to define your future self. \n\nRemember that every difficult moment of your life has now become a distant memory that in some minor or major way, has shaped who you are today. Be proud of that. Embrace it. We all wear scars underneath our skin and we\u2019re bound to be wounded again in the future. That\u2019s just how life works.\n\nSome people are lucky enough to just \u201ccoast\u201d through life without having to deal with financial stress, heart aches or other bullshit that life throws. But I\u2019ll tell you what. Some of the most interesting people I\u2019ve ever met are those that have faced anxiety and stress. \nYou are one of those interesting people. Never forget your worth.\n\nTake each day as a stepping stone toward your goals. Don\u2019t see a mountain as a giant hunk of rock to climb. See it as a bunch of little steps that may take a little while to reach the top. But you will eventually get there. It\u2019s inevitable. And sure, some parts of the mountain will be harder to climb than others. Some days are going to suck. You\u2019re going to want to cry and curl up in a ball because life\u2019s too hard. And that\u2019s 100% ok.\n\nBut remember, as long as you keep pushing forward, you will succeed. And baby steps are ok, in fact they are usually better than unpredictable long strides. If you have a bunch of shit you have to do today, or this week or this year try to aim to complete 1 important task per day. Make a list. Cross tasks off your list as you complete them. Make your bed every morning, that\u2019ll automatically give you a headstart for the rest of your day. Get rid of negative, toxic people from your life. You don\u2019t need that shit. All you need is you to get through life. \n\nWhoever you are, stay strong. You will get through this. Just breathe. And listen to Into the Black by Chromatics. Great music to calm down to. "

"This is something I've noticed myself doing often the last few years. When I'm stressed \\(not always consciously\\) I feel this really intense urge to shower more often and if I don't I feel really gross, as if I haven't showered in a week. So when this happens I usually take three \\(sometimes four\\) showers in a day.  I know it's terrible because I'm wasting so much water but I can't seem to help it. Does anyone else get this?"
"I\u2019m in my early 20s, work as a registered nurse and make a decent living, but I\u2019ve been so stressed over a lot of things going on in my life for the past year that I feel like I\u2019ve completely changed as a person. I never feel any happiness anymore, I\u2019ve become easily annoyed/irritable, I\u2019m in a constant state of worrying about everything all the time, and when I\u2019m off from work and able to get things done I end up sleeping all day because I\u2019m so tired\u2014 and then end up stressing over the fact that I\u2019ve done nothing but sleep. I\u2019ve gained a ton of weight and have started getting migraines and horrible stomach cramping, all of which I relate to how burnt out and stressed out I am. My relationships with my family and friends have been strained. My relationship with my boyfriend isn\u2019t the same, and we live together and he\u2019s even pointed out that I\u2019m not me anymore. I feel like my life is falling apart. I don\u2019t know how to snap out of this or find some motivation to distract myself or cope with all the stress I\u2019m going through. I just want to somehow climb out of this hole that I\u2019ve been stuck in."
"My 2017 was just a pile of crap. I had multiple family members die, our dog got hit by a car, I got investigated at a job and fired because someone made up rumors about me, got fired from a second job for no reason, and finally got into sales on strictly commission. Then there was a hurricane. We lost our home, so all of our stuff is in storage and we are living in a bedroom with family. Sales started good and now it\u2019s dead. \n\nWe have nothing. We have negative hundreds of dollars in our bank account because of auto-pay bills with $15 cash to our name and I won\u2019t get paid again next week. I don\u2019t know what else to do. I\u2019ve looked for other jobs, but nothing matches my previous salary that we built our bills around. Our credit is bad and relatively new, so we can\u2019t refinance cars right now or skip payments and we can\u2019t get loans because my partner doesn\u2019t make enough and I haven\u2019t been at this job long enough. I don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t get a second job because I work nearly 52 hours a week. My partner works full time and uses the downtime to do the laundry for me and run the other errands I can\u2019t during the day. I\u2019m just at an impass. Our family members don\u2019t have money for us to borrow. We have no credit cards.\n\nI just feel like everything is spiraling down and I can\u2019t control any of it. I was hoping 2018 would be better, but so far it isn\u2019t.\n\nAnyway, if you\u2019ve stuck with me this long, thanks for listening. I hate to burden my family with this kind of stuff because I feel guilty. I know there are are people who have absolutely nothing. I have clothes on my back and a roof over my head, but I\u2019m still worried because I don\u2019t have gas money to get to work or buy groceries. It\u2019s just a very helpless feeling.\n\nThanks again to anyone who is reading this. I appreciate you. "

"I am drowning in bills and rent like everyone else. I always make it, but I'm so constantly on edge worrying that I won't. I feel like it's taking a toll on my life. When I'm not working, I float between the two extremes of deep cleaning my entire house or staying in bed all day and hiding from the world. I wish I could find a happy medium. I'm having a hard time devoting time to friendships because I'm so wrapped up in my own head and stress routines. It's hard to reach out because I don't want to be a downer. The space behind my oven sure is clean though, so I guess that's a plus.\n\nI know I'm not the only one, so how do you cope with the stress of being alive?"
"\"Dear lord, please grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I cannot accept, and the wisdom and courage to tell the difference\"\n\nThe first few things I did at work today I messed up and I got really stressed because I wanted to to good. He told me to reset myself, and I repeated that prayer to myself over and over again and it felt like a huge release of stress. I hope it may help some of you <3"
"Seems to be my symptoms lately, anyone else get like this?"
"I have decided that today I am going to take back control of my life. I just wanted a record of it, or something.\n\nThanks."
"Gently place the tip of your index finger to the tip of your thumb on both hands with the other fingers gently outstretched. This is called the Gyan Mudra.\n\nYou've probably seen people do this during meditation. This activates a calming, relaxing sensation to your body and mind. It actually works! Try it right now for 5 minutes.\n\nYou can do this whenever you want for as long as you want. Please leave feedback and let me know how this works for you :)"
"knowing that i have to wake up early and stressing about sleeping in causes me to just not sleep at all."
"I failed a college class today and I just realized I\u2019ve been pacing for over an hour. I feel so much guilt and weight on my shoulders. I can\u2019t rest I can\u2019t sit for more than a few minutes. I tried watching tv but I still felt like I was going to throw up. I\u2019m having like a stress afterglow. My legs and arms are really shaky."

"I\u2019ve been under tremendous stress lately with work, my car (which i fucked up backing out of my driveway), and my relationship, and lately ive been having more and more nasty thoughts that arent really normal for me to have. i consider myself a down to earth dude with a lot of good hobbies and friends that keep my mind occupied, but the amount of stress ive been having has changed the way i think and behave in public, for example i have been socially checked out for the past couple of months, something that people have been pointing out to me recently. its caused me to lose track of my schedule and ive gone back into having recurring episodes of severe depression and im smoking cigarrettes on the DL, also not normal of me. worst of it all has been my thoughts, where i would randomly, without any provocation, think about the most fucked up things i could do to someone or something. i think its important to note these things because i feel like im not the only one in this position either, and as a person that struggles with mental health, i know its important to at least put your thoughts on text no matter how embarrassing. ill list a few specific examples of what some of these thoughts have been.\n\n-i was driving down a freeway and thought about running off a bridge at 65 mph, as well as running over pedestrians on the sidewalk without any feelings\n\n-i thought about shmacking my grandmas head with a frying pan for no fucking reason\n\n-i was on the line about deciding whether or not to push my friend into a lake when i know he cant swim well\n\nthose are just a few of those thoughts but i love my family and friends and would absolutely never voluntarily put anyone in danger. i dont exactly know if these thoughts are a by-product of my stress levels or if im a straight psycopath. again i really want to reiterate that i am a good person and its super abnormal for me to think something as horrific as what i described. if you also have these thoughts you should DM me or even comment bc no matter how embarrassing. its honestly relieving my stress right now just typing this out. thanks for understanding\n\nim going to post this elsewhere as well to hopefully help more people too"
"I'll do same for you any time if you wanna talk to me"
"Life is stressful. Obviously. I have been to several years of counseling as a child and I feel I have some pretty healthy coping mechanisms and communication skills. Lately though, life has been overwhelming. I am tired all the time and when conflicts happen between my SO and I I get physical chest pressure. I wouldn\u2019t determine this as a pain but more like difficulty breathing normally. Advice? "
"Just about every hour of every day, from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep way ahead of my bedtime, my heart is pounding like crazy as thoughts race through my head over the many, many, many, many, MANY different tasks I ought to complete. Even as I type now I feel like there's hundreds of things I ought to be getting done right this second. Whenever I take a moment to breathe several other things I need to or should have gotten done need to get done. Even if I try knocking out the simpler or more important things first, things develop and I need to follow up. Can ANYONE suggest a way of dealing with this? I might actually spontaneously combust..."
