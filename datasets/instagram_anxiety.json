I needed to simplify my outgoing current. It\u2019s been such a whirlwind of a year and I\u2019m learning that it\u2019s okay to step back from some things in order to steady the ground beneath me. There were many times I came to this account but my thoughts went blank. I had nothing to say. Nothing to share. My creativity switch turned to power-saving mode and sometimes it frustrated me but I also understood. It\u2019s okay for me to lean away from some things so I can better lean into others. A lot of my heart and energy pours into this space and I needed all the heart and energy I could muster to get me through this new transition. It\u2019s easy for some people to start something new and still juggle the other moving parts in their life but not for me. Something always has to give, even if it\u2019s just for a little awhile.

I\u2019m seeing my OCD specialist two times a month and continuing to see improvements in areas I never thought I would. There are still hard moments. There are still days when my brain plays tricks on me and my thoughts try to change the truthful narrative. But there are more good days now. So many more. This time last year I sat in my car thinking about ending my life because my OCD was so unmanageable. Here I am a year later lying in the grass outside the local farmers market, munching on some fresh cherries, writing for the first time in months, less than a week away from my 29th birthday, having the most amazing time planning our wedding and in good mental health. I am so thankful for all of that & I\u2019m thankful for all of you.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nCatch me up. How are you?\ud83d\udc9a", "***EDIT- This giveaway is now over!

By March 2018 I had been managing this account for 6 years. I never made a penny from it before then. People would say \u201cWow you could be making so much money! Why don\u2019t you do sponsored content?! I know this person and they made thousands off of just one post!\u201d Honestly, those suggestions always frustrated me. I wasn\u2019t in it for that. I created this community from the ground up because it\u2019s what I needed during the loneliest season of my life. There\u2019s no dollar amount that could have given me the comfort and support like I\u2019ve found here. I didn\u2019t want to capitalize off this safe place and be another person trying to market the latest fit tea or hair gummy in exchange for a check. I wouldn\u2019t do it.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nI was working in healthcare at that time. I loved the work I did but I hated the cost of doing it. I was barely making ends meet, had a growing credit card bill, immersed in toxic management and I was so fucking tired. Careful deliberation mixed with pure exhaustion and I made the decision that if I was going to make this account my career it had to be done my way. I had to create my own box for me to fit into. Mindful partnerships. Relevant sponsored ads. Complete and total transparency. It took hours of therapy for me to reframe my mindset and accept that I was worthy of financially supporting myself while also doing what I love. I\u2019ve never had both before. It\u2019s always been one or the other and the idea that I could possibly live a comfortable life while loving what I did seemed like a path worth exploring. So I quit. I took the biggest risk of my life and I quit to pursue that full-time influencer life but on my terms.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nAnd guess what?\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nI couldn\u2019t do it.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nI\u2019m just not built for it.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nMy storytelling doesn\u2019t work this way.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nMore to come on why I\u2019m going back to work.

I could even visualize it and of course my visualizations were always 100 times more dramatic than the situation would/could ever be. I imagined not being able to control myself, freaking out, and an ambulance having to take me to the doctor... needless to say as much as I feared this, it never happened. That\u2019s my biggest point today- almost all of our fears, biggest worries never come true or even close to true but we spend so much time thinking about them, playing them out like they exist and almost acting like it already happened sometimes. Comment \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if you can relate to that one. \nThen there is panic triggered by public. If you are anything like me you have created a correlation (That isn\u2019t true but youve convinced yourself it is) that going in public or to certain places will automatically cause a panic attack. I know I am very guilty of this. I let it get to the point of everywhere I had had a panic attack or felt my heart racing before I cut off ever going back to... which led to agoraphobia. I made a connection in my brain that being home was only safe. I wish someone would\u2019ve looked at me back then and said walk back into that store and don\u2019t leave- show yourself and your mind that that store isn\u2019t dangerous and the panic attack wasn\u2019t caused by the store it was caused by the fear and anxious thoughts I had leading up to the store. That\u2019s when I started exposure therapy with myself- showing my mind that the places I \u201cfeared\u201d going to due to having a past panic attack weren\u2019t dangerous but I related them to the panic attack and labeled them as dangerous. Showing myself and my mind that I can go there and be okay helped lessen the fear, which helped lessen the thoughts. If we constantly go into a situation with the mindset \u201cthis makes me anxious, i am worried about having a panic attack there because this this and this\u201d then we are ultimately setting ourselves up to panic. Next time, try to think ... continue in comments below", "\u201cI am\u201d two of the most powerful words known. I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t feel it, claim it.

You set the tone to what you want to be today. \u201cToday, I am brave and any anxiety that comes my way might be irritating but that\u2019s okay because I am brave and it will pass\u201d\nI used to think it was dumb to claim stuff like that... until I read the science behind it.

These unwanted thoughts are known as obsessions. What gives these thoughts power is when people who experience them become worried about the significance of the thoughts. Reminder: thoughts are just thoughts, they are not real nor harmful. \nSome examples of intrusive thoughts:\n1. \u201cI always feel like everyone is looking at me and laughing. If someone is laughing it has to be at me. If people are taking it\u2019s about me\u201d\n2. \u201cI truly feel something terrible is about to happen any second\u201d and then possibly seeing the scenario in your head of what you are worried about. \n3. \u201cI don\u2019t really love my significant other\u201d When they are the most important person in your life.\n4. \u201cMy children would be better off with a better mom. My husband only stays with me because I\u2019m free day care. No on loves me.\u201d These are just some.. then there are other deeper intrusive thoughts that you may be dealing with- thoughts of doing something impulsive. *TRIGGER WARNING*\nIn the past during my panic disorder I had the same intrusive thought come to my mind a few times while driving, it was when I was driving over a bridge \u201cwhat if I just drove off the ledge\u201d It wasn\u2019t an action thought but it was the most random thought that would appear and scare me. Back then before I knew how to cope with thoughts, I feared the thought was bigger than me and would cause me to do that. But the truth is thoughts are just thoughts and WE have the power. \nIf you experience intrusive thoughts, trust me I know its scary. I remember when I would get those thoughts I would feel \u201cbad\u201d for thinking that. But what I did to help was remind myself that it was just a thought, a thought cannot hurt me, a thought is an imagination not a real action. I have the power to not act on my thoughts. \nContinually going through the process in your mind when you get the these unwanted thoughts. \nSteps to take to deal with intrusive thoughts: \n1. Label your intrusive thoughts as \u201cjust thoughts\u201d Remind yourself they have no power.\n2. Remind yourself that you have the power and you can safely avoid them\n3.

He was the biggest blessing I could ever ask for and still is. \nThen there is my boyfriend and patches (his dog) - they were there for me before extreme anxiety, during extreme anxiety, and still here.\nI am forever thankful for all of them for sticking through the worst days. I won\u2019t say it was always perfect though, there were times he (and if the dogs could speak, they\ud83d\ude02) got frustrated, annoyed, needed space from my panic attacks, constant worries/googling symptoms, was sick of going to the doctor with me... but looking back when I was in the darkest, I didn\u2019t even understand myself. Something I\u2019ve learned through this journey is Grace- giving grace when others don\u2019t understand your battles, giving grace when others get a little frustrated at time and allowing them space because switch the roles in your mind.. would you have always been patient? We are all human. Giving grace is beautiful.\nAlong with this picture is my other favorite things- everything I used to help & healing and created into @anxietytoolkit it was such an amazing project for me to put together for no one to ever feel alone & to have a safe place! \nLast but not least, my favorite nights are spent with making a movie watching pallet on the amazing @lullbed with alll the fall smells!

cycle of thinking and anxiety is to Change your relationship with your thoughts. Allow the thoughts to come and almost be a bystander and question the validity of the thoughts you are thinking. Thoughts are not facts they are random messed up information and are well known for being aload of BS. By changing the way you react to your thoughts you are teaching your brain that there is an alternative way of thinking and instead of seeing the negative thoughts as a threat or danger your brain will dismiss the thoughts almost immediately.\n-\n-Journalling is a great way to start to put this into practice next time you recognise a negative thought write it down and next to it write down an alternative positive thought. This is giving your brain the alternative outlook practice practice practice until it becomes second nature and you are not having to write the thoughts down you will get to the stage where you are doing it subconsciously. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\n-\n-\ud83c\udfa8@thebraincoach\n-\n-#anxious #anxiousmind #anxiousthoughts #psychology #cbt #cognitivebehavioraltherapy #mindfullness #mindful #mentalhealthadvocate #mentalhealthawareness #dlcanxiety #saludmental #ansiedadegeneralizada\n@dlcanxietysupport", "Our first milestone we did it 100k and I would like to say a huge thanks to each and everyone of you for making this platform what it is!\n-\n-As a thank you I would like to do a 100k followers giveaway!\n-\n\ud83d\udc95What you will win\n-An anxiety relief box filled with lots of goodies plus a FREE 1 hour anxiety support session with me\n-\n-What's in the box:\n1] 3 scented candles for ultimate relaxation\n2] Lavender bath bomb, lavender has proven calming effects.\n3] gold plated positive statement necklace\n4] tube of multivitamins for all your extra vitamin support\n5]positive statement journal\n6] to do list sticky note pads\n7] rainbow pen\n8] positive statement magnet\n9] bar of delicious premium chocolate\n10] original flavour lip balm\n-\n\ud83d\udc95To enter:\n-like this post and tag your friends in the comments section you will get additional entries for each person you tag\n-Share this post on your stories and I will give you an additional five free entries!!\n-Winner will be announced 11pm Sunday 29th September\n\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\n-\n-#anxiousattachment\n#anxious #competition\n#giveaway #100kfollowers #100kgiveaway #thankyou #givingback #mentalhealthadvocate #journeytorecovery #stressrelief #dlcanxiety\n@dlcanxietysupport", "Our first milestone we did it 100k and I would like to say a huge thanks to each and everyone of you for making this platform what it is!\n-\n-As a thank you I would like to do a 100k followers giveaway!\n-\n\ud83d\udc95What you will win\n-An anxiety relief box filled with lots of goodies plus a FREE 1 hour anxiety support session with me\n-\n-What's in the box:\n1] 3 scented candles for ultimate relaxation\n2] Lavender bath bomb, lavender has proven calming effects.\n3] gold plated positive statement necklace\n4] tube of multivitamins for all your extra vitamin support\n5]positive statement journal\n6] to do list sticky note pads\n7] rainbow pen\n8] positive statement magnet\n9] bar of delicious premium chocolate\n10] original flavour lip balm\n-\n\ud83d\udc95To enter:\n-like this post and tag your friends in the comments section you will get additional entries for each person you tag\n-Share this post on your stories and I will give you an additional five free entries!!\n-Winner will be announced 11pm Sunday 29th September\n\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\n-\n-#anxiousattachment\n#anxious #competition\n#giveaway #100kfollowers #100kgiveaway #thankyou #givingback #mentalhealthadvocate #journeytorecovery #stressrelief #dlcanxiety\n@dlcanxietysupport"], "media": ["https://instagram.fsin8-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/e35/71527222_166657181146743_2248096330128832029_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fsin8-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&oh=8cf83a17bb50dfb6754195cd85a63a3c&oe=5E3C18C9&ig_cache_key=MjE0MTAxODY0MDIwNjU5Mjk4MQ%3D%3D.2", "https://instagram.fsin8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/e35/69553314_522141841694672_1457196001904078916_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fsin8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108&oh=14e821490720e5306bf42405c6516af1&oe=5E387966&ig_cache_key=MjE0MDU4NTM4NjM4NzM0MjE0OA%3D%3D.2", "https://instagram.fsin8-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/e35/70311805_479841649528561_4845519702105103724_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fsin8-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&oh=037f5caa6d9d72cde40a30e41df49317&oe=5E24F61F&ig_cache_key=MjE0MDIzNDI4NjY5NDEwMzI1OQ%3D%3D.2", "https://instagram.fsin8-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/e35/70335806_107396200540744_3773047455272995793_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fsin8-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&se=7&oh=65895d11964538aadc2043a0f74fea07&oe=5E3C6170&ig_cache_key=MjEzOTYxNDc2OTkyNDAyNzY3MA%3D%3D.2", "https://instagram.fsin8-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/e35/69665908_185477965950048_2496809290106816468_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fsin8-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100&se=7&oh=5dda43b3517040f9e8bd65d190c62e07&oe=5E246B28&ig_cache_key=MjEzOTYxNDc2OTkzMjQ5NTYwOQ%3D%3D.2"]}{"id": 8482181127, "texts": ["Haydee really just stuffed her shirt with toilet paper\ud83d\ude02 video almost out!

Understanding anxiety is the first step in managing it. In knowing its erratic nature, we can obtain a better sense of triggering situations and how our anxiety operates. That\u2019s where meditation comes in. \nWhether you frequently experience that butterflies in the stomach, sweaty palms, heart palpitations, upset stomach, or tightness in the chest feeling of adrenaline pumping or not, we know there are a myriad of benefits to meditation.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nSo what is stopping you from meditating?\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nThere is one reason that comes up time and time again, in my client sessions and across the world.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nI DON\u2019T HAVE TIME TO MEDITATE.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nIs this you?

We are making it too hard for ourselves. Staying in meditation for less than 10 minutes and you\u2019ve failed. There are no rules. 5 minutes is enough. Even 1 minute is enough! The person who watches their mind and breath for 1 minute a day is still receiving benefits over the person who never watches their mind. \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nPersonally, I usually meditate for 5-10 minutes here and there and it\u2019s become a really regular part of my life.

it on\u201d encompasses all the messy experiences of fear, power, bravery, discomfort, anxiety, and courage.\n.\n.\nWhen we find ourself standing at that proverbial fork in the road, we find ourselves with (at times) pretty tough decisions to make. In that moment, how do we engage with our experience? How do we engage with our uncertainty? How do we engage with our anxiety? One option we have is to avoid. To escape that moment of discomfort. To run from fear. To let fear choose our path for us. When this isn\u2019t in line with our values, what do we do?\n.\n.\nAnother option is this life motto: \u201chey anxiety, bring it on\u201d.\u00a0I say this to myself anytime I feel that tug of fear within myself urging me to flee. I use this as a gentle and compassionate reminder that I can allow fear to be a part of my experience without needing to do something about it.\n.\n.\n\"Yes, anxiety. Yes, fear. If you want to join me in this experience then you are welcome, but you do not get a drivers\u00a0seat position. You can watch me live my life according to my values and not your own. I got this.\u201d\n.\n.\nReminder: You can do hard things. You can do brave things. I believe in you SO much. You got this!\n.\n. \n#ocd #ocdrecovery #obsessivecompulsivedisorder #intrusivethoughts #compulsion #boundaries #anxiety #fear #anxietydisorder #gad #bfrb #eatingdisorder #panicdisorder #socialanxiety #phobia #depression #agoraphobia #mentalhealth #perfectionism #exposureresponseprevention #exposuretherapy #mindfulness #exposure #cbt #recovery #anxietyrecovery #yougotthis #selfcompassion #wecandohardthings", "We may think that just one more compulsion, just one more ritual, will be enough to satisfy OCD. OCD will then be satiated and leave us alone. The frustrating reality is that no amount of rituals will satisfy that doubt, that discomfort, that uncertainty. It may feel like it\u2019s better momentarily, but because of the way a ritual negatively reinforces intrusive thoughts and the resulting anxiety, the cycle will happen\u00a0again.\u00a0The rituals are food for those experiences to get stronger and keep coming back.\n.\nAn example of a negative reinforcement cycle: I have a headache. I feel pain and I do not want to be in pain. I then take headache medicine with the goal of getting rid of the pain. As a result of taking the medicine, the headache goes away. The behavior of taking the medicine was reinforced by the diminishment of my pain. What happens next time? I\u2019m now more likely to have that thought of \u201coh I should take medicine!\u201d the next time I have a headache and then follow through with my behavior of taking the medication.\n.\nRituals function the same way. We perform them with the intention of getting rid of our anxiety/doubt/discomfort/fear. It may \u201cwork\u201d momentarily but because of this temporary relief, that intrusion is now being reinforced as a dangerous thing that we need to ritualize around.\n.\nThis is why ERP is so difficult. We have to sit with our anxiety and really invite it to be a part of our experience without engaging in rituals intended to take that discomfort away. Over time and consistency, that reinforcement cycle breaks apart and we can learn new things about the experience of an intrusion (thoughts are just thoughts) and anxiety (anxiety is unpleasant but not dangerous) and uncertainty (it is a part of the human experience and can be embraced). This can be so hard but it is so worth it! You are worth it!\n.\nI believe in your ability to do hard things! I believe in YOU!

That the experience of fear removes any opportunity for strength? I believe it\u2019s actually quite the contrary. It is a strength to be able to make values-based decisions amid feeling fear and anxiety. It is a strength to feel fear and discomfort and tolerate that experience. It is a strength to get up each day knowing there is a battle ahead (or present). Feeling fear is not a sign of weakness but rather a sign of humanness.\n.\n.\nHumans (including yourself) will experience a myriad of emotional experiences. This includes fear, anxiety, discomfort, etc. I believe in your ability to redefine your definition of strength (if it needs it). I believe in your ability to validate your strength in living each day fighting against fear and anxiety making your choices. I believe in your ability to do hard things. I believe in YOU!

Sometimes (oftentimes?) it will be \u201ceasier\" to make a decision based on fear rather than your values. This leads to an immediate feeling of relief; however, that relief is temporary. It also might be coupled with regret, sadness, and demoralization. That fear-based avoidance actually reinforces the scary stimuli leading to a stronger fear association.\n.\n.\nTo choose values over fear is such a strength. You may tremble the whole time. You may feel fear coursing through your veins. Part of you may wish you hadn\u2019t said \u201cbring it on\u201d to your anxiety. The situation might not play out the way you had hoped it would, but there is such tremendous benefit to making decisions based on values.

Something clicked and after a long time of fighting every suicidal thought or urge I had, I just couldn\u2019t fight it anymore. I took an overdose last night. The world was not on my side and everything got too much for me. The good news is is that I\u2019m safe, I\u2019m home and hopefully the mental health team I\u2019ve been discharged to will actually start to do something. However, and let this be a lesson to you all, I massively regret my decision to do something of the sort - I was overwhelmed and quite honestly done fighting with all my might everyday. Yes this is a huge setback and yes an all time low but I\u2019m trying to turn it around and find the positives in what was a horrific experience. I\u2019m safe, I\u2019m at home (which I\u2019m grateful for as there was potential of being put on a psych ward), I\u2019m going to start (hopefully) getting the help I need, I\u2019m confident that next time I will speak to my parents before I get to this point and I\u2019m hoping it will be the start of turning my life around for the better. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve let anyone down or disappointed anyone, life just got too much for me but please know that I\u2019m in a more positive mindset this morning and I feel ready to start fighting once again and beat these stupid illnesses! I can do this. I want to thank my incredible (understatement) friends who were there for me last night - I don\u2019t know what I would do without you. Anyway I\u2019m safe and that\u2019s what matters. Keep fighting everyone and if anyone has any questions just drop me a message and I\u2019ll try my best to answer honestly.

It\u2019s exhausting it\u2019s draining it\u2019s upsetting. It feels like the life is being sucked out of you and the small amount of energy you have takes all your effort to use. I\u2019m sad to say that a lot of my smiles are forced at the moment - and when you\u2019re depressed it really does take all your effort to smile. A lot of the time it feels like the world is crumbling around you and even getting out of bed in the morning is a task that pretty much hoovers up all your energy. Depression is real and depression sucks! BUT: things will get better, there will be happy times and you will continue to make amazing memories. Use the people around you as motivation to get better and live a happier life. Don\u2019t let depression win all the time (sometimes is fine) but not all the time. Keep fighting everyone - you can do this!! Xxx #depression #ocd #stopthestigma", "Please read: if someone were to see me looking like this I.e. in my pjs in the mid afternoon with a blanket wrapped around myself, they would probably ask if I was unwell. With the absence of a cold or the flu or anything of the sort I would probably automatically answer \u2018no\u2019. But in reality the answer is yes. Yes I am unwell! Just not physically. Today my depression is getting the better of me, my mental illness is dominating so yes I am unwell/not feeling very well/ill. But I would never openly answer yes to that question in reference to my mental health. It\u2019s a difficult one because answering yes to that question opens up a whole new conversation with the person asking the question but it would be the truth. Mental illness is still an illness and I think, although resilience and fight is obviously needed, we should still treat it like it\u2019s an illness simply because that\u2019s what it is.

I call it the standing guard cycle. This cycle presupposes that if a health anxiety sufferer stands guard at the doorway of their body throughout each and every moment of their life, and reacts instinctively and fearfully to anything that may seem \u2018abnormal\u2019 to them in their body, they stay in the safe zone. The safe zone is to be able to maintain this run of survival they have going, to hope for change but to run the same mental, emotional habits from day to day due to the formula that safety lies within worry, and safety lies within what\u2019s been familiar.\n.\nStanding guard means to tense up the body, this is something the health anxiety sufferer doesn\u2019t recognize though because they are solely concerned about the impulsive reaction to what they view as an abnormal feeling in the body. By standing guard though we tense up the body and internal organs causing an even greater amount of misinterpretations to any external stimuli that shows up. A tense body picks up on other peoples language that may touch on the topic of illness instantly. A tense body will become 100 times more stimulated to sound, smell, and taste.\n.\nStanding guard keeps the anxious identity in tact, in fact strengthening it by the day. The longer a paradigm, or a set of habits have been in place, the more difficult it becomes to break. Why would your system begin seeing the sensations and the world in a whole different light? It kept you alive up to now didn\u2019t it? It did, but it sucks to live by standing guard constantly. If the subconscious mind/body wants to stand guard, that fine, that\u2019s it\u2019s job anyway which is to keep you safe and to keep you happy. But the conscious mind doesn\u2019t have to join in.
