"Hello, I\u2019ve read a lot of posts recently about folks missing classes and feeling too anxious to come back. Don\u2019t worry. We would much rather you come back to our classes than continue to miss. We teach because we care about you individually. We care about what\u2019s going on in your lives. I know it\u2019s easy to see professors as these omnipresent overlords but know that we are human and we have definitely been in your position before. Please feel better and know that you are always welcome back into class. Just shoot us an email and let us know what\u2019s up so we can help you make up the work you missed.\n"
