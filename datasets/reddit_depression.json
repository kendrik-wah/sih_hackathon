"It\u2019s a constant sense of wanting to go somewhere else. I\u2019d feel better if i was at this place. Then you go there and then it\u2019s the same exact feeling, just in a different physical location. \n\nI feel mentally homeless and I just want to go home.\n\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t think this would get traction and that\u2019s my first gold. Thanks buddy."
"I can't hide, I can't cry out loud, they don't understand me if I can't clean my room or can't go out. They watch me fall apart and criticise me while it happens."
"I woke up today wanting to die. I was planning on doing it after school so I decided school was pointless to go to. I walked to the mall by my school and went to a Kneader's and ordered french toast. French toast has always been my favorite so I figured it would be a good last thing to eat. I pondered a ton about my life and what it is I really want. I felt super empty but also my mind was racing with thoughts. I had convinced myself I needed to finish my life today. I had been thinking for about half an hour when an elderly man sat across from me and gave me a hot chocolate. He said that he ordered it for me because he could tell I needed it. He told me \"I don't know what you're going through, but life will get better.\" And then he left. And then I cried. And now I'm back at school, and I think I want to live. \n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who responded to this and messaged me and just were so kind. <3 "
"This is me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s better than don\u2019t-leave-my-bed-for-a-week depression. I am grateful I can be an independent person. But there is something uniquely horrible about being able to go to work every day, occasionally clean up after yourself, pay your bills, generally put yourself together enough to look like a human being... but that\u2019s it. Nothing else. No social life. No hobbies. Constantly battling your mind. And being absolutely fucking exhausted all the time."
"Recently I thought I was beginning to feel better. Not quite happy, but just sort of... I don\u2019t know, content? But my depression always seems to come back, sometimes stronger than others. This has happened in the past too. I\u2019m worried that one day the gust of depression will blow too strongly and the branch i\u2019m hanging onto will snap. Or maybe not. That could just be the apathy speaking though. Anybody else really frustrated by this? It feels like i\u2019m always walking a razors edge between being fine, and being depressed and one misstep causes me to lose my balance. Ugh. \n\nEdit: evidently, there are quite a few people who experience similar feelings. I just want to say that it makes me happy in a sad sort of way to know that we are all going through something similar in our lives. It makes things less lonely."
"I wrote a suicide note earlier in the morning. I spent most of the day doing things that used to make me happy: getting coffee, walking in the park, listening to music, etc. I ate my \u201clast meal\u201d while listening to Bob Marley.\n\nAbout an hour before I was going to kill myself, my friend from college messaged me and asked to play Xbox. We ended up reminiscing on good times, and laughing our asses off. It felt nice to feel like somebody cared about me. We\u2019re planning on playing tomorrow too.\n\nI don\u2019t feel as bad as I did earlier today and I also am glad that I didn\u2019t kill myself.\n\nEdit: thank you for the gold, friend:)\n\nEdit: thank you for the silver, friend:) I\u2019m currently sitting at a coffee shop, reading all the kind messages everyone has sent. It means a lot to me"
"I look normal on the outside, but that's because I try very hard to."
"You\u2019re depressed!\n\nYou\u2019re okay, it\u2019ll take time, but you\u2019re okay!\n\nWhat the hell is taking so long, life blows, you\u2019re depressed again!\n\nYou woke up and got dressed today, it\u2019s looking up from here?\n\nSIKE, you fucking idiot, did you truly believe your depression was done with you? You\u2019re dumber than you lead yourself to believe!\n\nOkay, we\u2019re okay, we\u2019re gonna make it. I just gotta stay strong.\n\nOop, you fucked up once today, I\u2019m dragging your ass back into the dark. \n\nOVER AND OVER AND OVER! \n\nIs there really only one way out? I don\u2019t know if I wanna die, I got a brother who may need me one day. I\u2019m tired. So tired, man."
"Thank you all for the supportive messages. It\u2019s heartwarming to know that I\u2019m not alone. I know we can all get through this together. I love each and every single one of you "
"I don\u2019t know if that makes sense. What I mean is that I stay up as late as possible wasting time because I know that if I go to sleep, I\u2019ll wake up and have to go to school. I usually go to bed at around 3:30am and get up at 6am and it\u2019s destroying me, I\u2019ve been doing this for months and I\u2019m physically weak and exhausted constantly because of it but my depression and anxiety demand it. And they always seem to get their way. \n\nEdit: I\u2019m really glad that this spoke to so many people, it feels good knowing I\u2019m not alone. Sending lots of love to you all. This isn\u2019t easy but I believe in you \u2764\ufe0f"
"Does anyone else feel this way?  This has been crossing my mind a lot lately\n\nEDIT: I just want to thank everyone for the thoughtful, kind comments I've been recieving.  It's been a nice change and I really appreciate it.  You guys are the best.  :)"
"Just curious if anyone else affected by this problem also noticed quite a big cognitive decline. Or if anyone has noticed a cognitive decline and managed to build themselves back up to that previous cognitive level."
"But here I am, 24 years old man and doing exactly that."
"Happens to me a lot. Cooking, walking to class, brushing my teeth...sometimes I just stop for like a minute, feel a tremendous sense of self-hatred and suicidal ideation, and then continue on as if nothing ever happened."
"17 F\nAll my life I've lived in a small little \"redneck\" town in North Carolina with conservative parents. My Dad is a pastor at our local church and both of my parents are EXTREMELY religious. They both hate gay people. I've known I was gay since I was a child but have always been scared about coming out in fear that they would reject me because they are very homophobic people. Whenever my parents see someone gay on TV they always say things like \"Look at that fucking faggot\" or \"That's disgusting\" and it just breaks my heart. I hate living with those fucking homophobes and I always take out my hatred by cutting myself. So far I've cut around 30 scars all over my thighs, butt, legs, and lower back. No one has ever seen these scars because I always wear jeans to cover them. At least not until a few days ago.\n\nWe were having a baby shower for my cousin and my mom insisted I wear a short ugly little dress that comes up to about my lower thigh. You could see every single fucking scar on my legs. I tried my best to cover the scars with my arms but when I stood up after dinner she saw them. She pointed at my legs and asked me what the hell is that so I told her everything. About how depressed I've been. About how many times I've contemplated suicide over the last few months. And about how I'm a lesbian. \n\nMy parents flipped the fuck out.\n\nMy dad started screaming a bunch of religious shit while throwing food at me. He told me that being gay was a sin and I was going to hell for this. He told me he didn't want \"no faggot daughter\". Then he angrily stomped out the room. My mom just looked at me in disgust for a few minutes before she spoke. She said, and these are her exact words, \"Just kill yourself you gay little bitch, you're not my daughter anymore.\"\n\nThat's all. She just said that and walked out.\n\nIt's been two days since that happened and now my parents refuse to talk to me. When they see me around the house they just ignore me like I'm not even there.\n\nI hate my life. So much.\n\nEDIT: Omg thank you guys for all the nice comments!!! I'm turning 18 next week so I'll probably be moving out then."
"Like, the old me wasn\u2019t even that great either but damn "
"I hate being told: \"It'll get better when you're older.\" No it fucking won't. I've waited for over a decade for things to get better & they haven't. It's especially not true when I see people younger than me living better, happier, & more interesting lives. Clearly that means I'm a failure & I just can't properly do this game we call life.\n\nJust today someone I know who's younger than me just managed to find their own apartment with their SO. I can't do that now & if that doesn't scream that I'm a pathetic loser, I don't know what does."
"I was depressed, failing school, etc and I decided I should do my homework at a coffee shop one day. I went in and the owner was super nice and asked me if I wanted to join the rewards program and I was really craving community at this point and I was super excited. \nI kept coming back to the shop to do my homework and the owner and the baristas would always welcome me and they were always happy to see me. I started to get to know everybody there very well and now I consider them all friends. \nI found that when depressed having different communities helps a lot, and it turns out a lot of the other regulars at coffee shops also are depressed or have other mental illnesses. \nA two dollar drink can let you stay there for a few hours and by being nice to everyone around you and being somewhat productive on work it can be a really great place to have"
"It feels like the harder I try to better myself, the harder it pushes back."
"i feel this way around everyone, friends, family, coworkers, anywhere i go. i just always feel like i\u2019m in the background. but at the same time i like going unnoticed so i don\u2019t have to talk to anyone and be in the spotlight.."
